// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

// console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// JavaScript runs your code from top to bottom.
// cityOfBirth hasn’t been created yet, so JavaScript doesn’t know what it is.
