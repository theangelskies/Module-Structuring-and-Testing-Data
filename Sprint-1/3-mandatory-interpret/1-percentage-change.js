// let carPrice = "10,000";
// let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";

// carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
// priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll("," ""));

// const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
// const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

// console.log(`The percentage change is ${percentageChange}`);

// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
// A function call is when you use () after a function name.
// carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")
// Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")) 
// priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll("," "") 
// Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll("," "")) 
// console.log(...) 
//Implicit function calls - toString()
// Total: More than 5 function calls 

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
// There is a syntax error: a missing comma between the arguments of replaceAll.
// Correct syntax: replaceAll(",", "")
let carPrice = "10,000";
let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";

carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));

const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

console.log(`The percentage change is ${percentageChange}`);

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements
// Variable reassignment is when you change the value of a previously declared variable
// Lines 5 and 6
// carPrice = Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", ""));
// priceAfterOneYear = Number(priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(",", ""));

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
// Lines 1, 2, 8 and 9
// let carPrice = "10,000";
// let priceAfterOneYear = "8,543";
// const priceDifference = carPrice - priceAfterOneYear;
// const percentageChange = (priceDifference / carPrice) * 100;

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
// The expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",", "")) removes commas from a string representation of a number and converts it to a number.
